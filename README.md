## 🏢 Executive Briefing

**LeakHunter** is the premier cybersecurity intelligence platform engineered to safeguard global identities from the financial and reputational devastation of data breaches. Powered by **Quantum Intelligence (Next-Gen AI)** and our proprietary **High-Velocity Indexing**, LeakHunter provides the vigilance and rapid-response capabilities required to maintain operational integrity in an era of evolving cyber threats.

> *"We translate complex, fragmented breach data into actionable defensive maneuvers, empowering organizations to proactively neutralize threats before they scale."*

<br />

## 🌌 The Intelligence Matrix: Core Capabilities

### 🔍 Deep-Protocol Search Terminal
Uncover compromised assets across the surface, deep, and dark web with surgical precision.
- **88B+ Record Access**: Real-time querying across the world's most comprehensive breach repository.
- **Surgical Tracing**: Execute traces via Email, Username, Phone (International), Domain, and IP Vectors.
- **Threat Scoring Matrix**: Instant risk categorization (1-100) based on payload sensitivity and proximity.

### 🛡️ Next-Gen AI Suite (Guardian Agent)
Our proprietary neural nodes rotate through a failover matrix to provide non-stop intelligence support.

1. **Forensic Analyst Node 🧠**: Standard results are upgraded with deep neural assessment of password hygiene and structural pattern evolutions.
2. **Guardian Agent (Legal AI) 📜**: Automated drafting of legally-sound **DMCA and DSAR** takedown requests to force data removal at the source.
3. **Response Architect 🛠️**: Generates step-by-step mitigation protocols for individual users to secure compromised accounts instantly.

### 🛰️ Watchtower Surveillance
Continuous, autonomous monitoring of your digital assets.
- **Active Asset Pinging**: Get notified the millisecond your data surfaces in a new repository.
- **Domain-Wide Monitoring**: Enterprise clusters to monitor entire corporate domains for employee leaks.
- **Shadow Detection**: Identification of leaked subdomains and internal service configurations.

<br />

## ⚡ Technical Architecture (High-Fidelity)

### **Frontend Interface (Intelligence Terminal)**
*   **Engine**: React 19 / TypeScript (Verbatim Module Syntax)
*   **Dynamics**: Framer Motion & CSS Variables for fluid "Glassmorphism"
*   **Visuals**: Recharts (Custom high-density configurations) & Lucide Icon Clusters
*   **UX**: Real-time neural typewriter streaming effects for AI output

### **Backend Core (Processing Hub)**
*   **Protocol**: Laravel 11 / PHP 8.3 (High-performance API nodes)
*   **Neural Node**: Gemini 2.0 Flash (Optimized for low-latency pattern recognition)
*   **Persistence**: MySQL with specialized breach-indexing optimizations
*   **Resilience**: Intelligent Multi-Key Failover Matrix for 99.9% AI availability

<br />

## 🛠️ API & Developer Integration

LeakHunter provides a robust REST API for automated security operations (SecOps).

```bash
# Execute an intelligence trace via terminal
curl -X POST https://leakhunt3r.xyz/api/search \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"query": "target@mail.com", "limit": 100}'
```

- **Webhook Support**: Receive real-time JSON payloads for new breaches.
- **SDK Availability**: Official wrappers for Python, Node.js, and Go.
- **Enterprise Limits**: Custom rate limits and multi-seat API management.

<br />

## 🛡️ Operational Ethics & Security

- **Zero-Log Infrastructure**: We do not store your search queries. Logs are purged immediately after trace completion.
- **E2E Encryption**: All data transmitted between your terminal and our nodes is protected by AES-256-GCM.
- **Hardware Isolation**: Proprietary indexing nodes are physically isolated to prevent cross-contamination.

<br />

## 🤖 Meet the LeakHunter AI Assistant
Meet your dedicated security companion. Integrated throughout the terminal, the **LeakHunter AI Assistant** provides real-time support, explains complex breach vectors, and guides you through remediation. Whether you are a security pro or a business owner, the assistant ensures you are never left in the dark.
